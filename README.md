# UFOs


#Purpose
  The purpose of this assignment was to create a webpage based on UFO sightings and to be able to specifically filter out dates in order to
  retrieve the appopriate data.
  
#Results
  When it comes to the end result a user would be able to utlize the search boxes as shown below in order to find the appopriate information that they were
  searching for. They can ustilize the search boxes in order to narrow a search by date, location and even the duration of the event.

#Summary

   One of the drawbacks when looking at this site is that I specifically ran into an issue where the data itself was populated, however, I had ran 
   into an error where I was not able to have the code show and iformation. It may have came from an imporitng issue, however, I was unsucessful when 
   troubleshooting it. When it comes to a drawback when looking at it subjectively, there seems to be no references when it comes to showing where the
   data came from.
   
   Two additional reccomendations that I can make is that implementing references within the data in order to give more credibility to the data. Furthermore, another
   option can be more of a story when it comes to the comments because it seems to not have much detail other than a brief statement.
